# Chingu Trivia - Tier 3

This is my Chingu Solo Project of [Tier 3 - Chingu Trivia](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier3-chingu-trivia). 

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for this project and created a node.js server to host the project and fetch the api.

## App's Purpose / Function 

First is the topic buttons for the different types of questions from the api that is provided. 

Once one of the topic buttons are clicked the trivia of that topic starts and the first question appears. 

## Dependencies

The other dependencies that I used that are not included from Create React App are:

- express
- axios

## Build/Deploy Instructions

The following commands are to build and deploy the project on a local server after you download or clone the project.

### `npm run build`

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
